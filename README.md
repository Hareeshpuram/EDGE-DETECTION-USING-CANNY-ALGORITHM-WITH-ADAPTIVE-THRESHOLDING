<H1>EDGE DETECTION USING CANNY ALGORITHM WITH ADAPTIVE THRESHOLDING</H1>
 ABSTRACT:
      Edge detection is a fundamental task in image processing that aims to identify boundaries between objects or regions within an image. In this project, we explored the use of thresholding technique - adaptive thresholding in combination with the Canny edge detection algorithm to improve the accuracy of edge detection in images. To understand the influence of noise and filter on the performance of modified Canny edge detection algorithm, we utilized addition of Gaussian noise to the original input images at different levels followed by Gaussian filter to eliminate the noise in the image. 
      
      The performance of the edge detection algorithms was analyzed under four different conditions: (1) with noise and filtering, (2) without noise and filtering, (3) with noise but without filtering, and (4) without noise but with filtering. Our experimental results for gray scale images demonstrate that the adaptive thresholding combined with Gaussian filter provides superior performance for edge detection even for larger noise levels (~50%).
